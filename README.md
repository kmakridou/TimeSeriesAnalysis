# TimeSeriesAnalysis


This GitHub project is a Python script that generates, analyzes, and visualizes time series data. It utilizes the NumPy, Matplotlib, and statsmodels libraries. The script starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading data from a CSV file. It then generates random values and creates time series data based on a linear transformation of the loaded data and the random values.The script includes plots to visualize the generated time series data and analyze its autocorrelation. It also introduces noise to the data and performs smoothing using a moving average filter.
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive workflow for generating, analyzing, and visualizing time series data, allowing for further exploration and experimentation in the field of time series analysis.
